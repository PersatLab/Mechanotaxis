# Mechanotaxis
Here you can find code and data used in the paper "Mechanotaxis directs Pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching motility".

The analysis for our paper combines codes for Matlab, ImageJ and Python.

The code is organized in folders corresponding to our Extended Methods in our SI Appendix.

A readme.txt in each folder explains how to run the code.
