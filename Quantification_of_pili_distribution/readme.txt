To obtain the pili count distribution between the poles we analyzed our iSCAT movies with the following ImageJ macro:
  1. ImageDataExtraction/Fluorescence_and_pilicounts_auto_pole_frame_reccord_PoleCorr.ijm
  2. Using a brightfield image as reference
  
To analyse and plot our data of Figure S3 use the following jupyter notebook:
